 Q. What is Binary Search Algirithm ?
 
 - Binary Search is the process of searching an element from sorted Array by repetedly
 dividing the search interval in half.
 
 - Binary search is faster than linear search.
 
 - Although Binary search is very optimised way of searching a particular element 
 however the Array must be sorted on which you want to perform the search operation.
 
 - If the array is not sorted in advanced then we have to perform sorting first and then 
 only we can perform Binary Search on that.
